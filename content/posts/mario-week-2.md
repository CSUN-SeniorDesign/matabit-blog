For week 2, The majority of the work for setting up and getting the infrastructure up and running was done during week 1. My main priority for week 2 was updating and providing documentation for the tasks I was assigned in the project0 and creating slides for our presentation about our project. The documentation I was assigned to create was for configuring and setting up Route 53 and setting up an Amazon web services account.

Providing Documentation

The documentation for Route 53 sole purpose was provide information for anyone and to explain in detail on how to setup and configure Route 53 from scratch in case a problem was to arise in the future. The documentation for the Amazon web services account explains in detail on how to sign up for an Amazon account and the step by step process on how to do it. The AWS documentation also explains on how to sign up for AWS educate program for students in order to acquire free $100 credit to use for resources. Also included in the documentation is how to create an organization to include all the team members in the same account and to pool in all the credits for the whole team to use. 

Preparing for Presentation

The second thing I worked on in week 2 was preparing for our presentation for the class. I was assigned to make slides for Route 53 and talk about how we configured it and set it up as well as show the class a screenshot of our Route 53 records and explain a little about each record and what its function is. For the presentation I was also assigned to talk about Issues like Learning GitHub and bash commands on windows systems that we ran into working on the project. For example, I was having issues with learning GitHub and getting familiar with the website. Some issues I had were learning how to navigate around the website, managing pull requests, and looking up docs. Second issue we had was using bash commands, which for me was tough because I was not too familiar with the language. Also using new programs like cmder and visual studio was new to me. One issue we all had as a team was git commands on windows systems, which were different then commands on Apple and Linux systems. 

What’s next?

Our next project hasn’t been posted yet, but the professor mentioned to us that it will have to do with Ansible and Terraform. So over the weekend the team will be studying and getting familiar with both products in order to be properly prepared for project 1 in the following week.
