# Week 9

## Finishing project 4
For project 4 we were tasked with finding the cheapest option to be able to host our blog through AWS. We found that the cheapest method would be to host the site in an S3 bucket. For our assignment I was tasked with writing the detailed design, describing our infrastructure from a top-down approach:

```
Users will connect to website via a URL in a web browser. URLs that can be used to connect to the website are matabit.org, www.matabit.org, and blog.matabit.org. Route53 contains the records for each of these domains and will forward inbound traffic to the appropriate AWS service. In this case, traffic will be forwarded to a CloudFront distribution. This CloudFront will actually be hosting our web content on a network of global data centers known as “edge locations.” Edge locations will provide redundancy in the event of service downtime and also provide low-latency for users as they connect to the data center closest to them geographically. The CloudFront will be able to retrieve the site from an S3 bucket which is an object storage solution that will contain and store the contents of our website. The S3 bucket will be continuously updated with the newest version of the website with CircleCI: a continuous delivery pipeline solution. As new blog posts are pushed into the Github repository, CircleCI will check the build for any issues and will deploy the build to the S3 bucket if none are found. CircleCI will have IAM access to the bucket with PUT permissions to store new objects. This will make the latest version of the site available for the CloudFront distribution to pull from the S3 bucket and host on its edge locations for web users to access. New blog posts content will be generated by Hugo which will create markdown files from posts pushed into our blog Github repository. Our AWS infrastructure, such as Route53, CloudFront, and S3, will be created using Terraform to allow for easy build-up and tear-down of our infrastructure.

## Senior design projects
For this past week we hve been listening to project proposals from outside guests, professors, and students. One of the projects that initially stood out to me was the one proposed by the Estate Planning Attorney to develop a system that allows users to fill out information on an online form and have that information placed into the correct spots on a paper document that's available for purchase. This project stood out to me because I believe building the infrastructure for such a project would be very similar to what we have already been building and would be a good way to apply that to a real-world application. Other projects I found that might be interesting to work on were the student permission-numbers system which could also be built within AWS as well as the advancing technology lab.
